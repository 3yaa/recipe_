Running the command "npm start" will boot the website.

When running you will be told all the libraries you are missing to run the program. You can also view package.json to see all the lbraries I used (there are some I did not get the chance to use).

The recipes that is pulled from spoonacular unfornutely had a limit of 150 pulls for a day. So too much loading on the search and cuisines can break the website.

I did not get the chance to implement all the features I was planning to add, due to time constrains and some personal circumtances. For future versions, I would like to implement a database to store the logins. Where each each user will have the chance to rate each recipe on the scale on how much they liked it and how much work it was (2 ratings). I was also planning on implementing a diary feature, where you can push your own recipies that will be saved on your account.
